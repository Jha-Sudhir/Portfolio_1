      <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
      <p>I like reading books of different genre but to buy it every time becomes too expensive or sometimes it becomes difficult to find.
        And also a books which I read remain in self for months and years, it occupies self space and it starts diminishing its worth.
        I want to make my self dynamic and also want to read as many books as possible.
        Once you read, it might become less valuable for you, but its worth spending time and money to someone else.
        Therefore, I would like to make a platform where a person can Borrow or Buy.
